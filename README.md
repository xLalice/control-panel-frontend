3.  **Install Dependencies:** Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) in *both* the `frontend` and `backend` directories.
4.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and add the `VITE_API_URL` variable.
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add all the required backend variables listed above. Obtain the necessary keys and connection strings.
5.  **Database Setup (Backend):**
    * Ensure your database server (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) is running.
    * Run Prisma migrations to set up the database schema: `npx prisma migrate dev --name init` (or appropriate migration command).
